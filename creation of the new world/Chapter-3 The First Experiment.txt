“President it's urgent we need to talk”,Carl Ritter said.“What is it now,and why are you so worried”,Jackson Rey said.“I need to talk about the astroid that fell about 6 weeks ago in Crodopia,district 11”,Carl Ritter.“oh that, didn't I told you to take care of that incident”,Jackson Rey said.“Yeah! about that,we for a mysterious substance and it works as a catalyst for atomic fission,Carl Ritter said.“So what!”,Jackson Rey said.“We were able to create a high spec fission reactor with it and we created an inter continental ballistic laser which outputs a laser of about 25000°C and we were also able to create a container to hold that much energy”,Carl Ritter said.

“So now what are you saying,you want to blow up entire nation,that's never happening and destroy that weapon immediately”Jackson Rey.“But why! We can dominate the entire world and no one will be able to lift a finger against us”,Carl Ritter said.“no means no, Humanity didn't achieve peace due to such weapons and you are going to destroy that weapon right now.Now get out of my sight”,Jackson Rey left the room angrily.

“Oh! You will see i am going to make you pay for what you have said to me today”,Carl Ritter thought with a grin on his face.

Secret Agent Enters the room in which Carl was standing.“What do you have to report and make it quick I am not in a good mood today”,Carl.“Sir! We investigated the civilian named John liva and he has gone missing since having acute headache from the ambulance”,Agent said.“Dammit can't you even a single thing right”,Carl said angrily.“Sorry Sir! But we were able to track his laptop and we found out that he indeed had a log on the alien substance and he named it chromatinum we also found useful data on the substance through his experiment logs”,Agent said.“Chromatinum that's actually a nice name.Tell me more if you find any clues of his whereabouts,you are dismissed for now”,Carl said.Agent left the room.

At the same time at The Graudaur's laboratory in the middle of nowhere.Graudaur had completed his First research on Constant gene Evolution and controlled cell division.He created an injection of stem cells that could change a creature's entire DNA structure and add extra scripts for the desired mutation.Graudaur had also downloaded an evolution blueprint for a mutated wolf.This blueprint indicated a wolf of Height 4 Meters with Super strength,speed,stamina with ultra fast Regenerative abilities.

“Yess Finally! Completed the project Beast Wolf now I just need to test this solution on a Alpha male of a wolf pack”,Graudaur said to himself with excitement.Suddenly a 38inch Moniter in front Graudaur showed an Alert message.“What a lucky Guy I am just finished a project and found a testing subject right away”,Graudaur  said to himself.Graudaur left the Underground laboratory and started hunting the Wolfs until he found an Alpha male.He grabbed his head and injected the stem cells into the skull of the wolf mercilessly.after finishing the preparation he got an message from the lab into his head which was ‘System has detected a suspecious activity are the forest around th forest,it's humans,there target seems to be you My master’.
“Look Who's here Let's test the weapon right away,shall we”,Graudaur said to himself.

The Solution created by Graudaur was perfect but it required a astronomical amount of nourishment to Work practically.so as to  counter that Graudaur installed a gene unbearable hunger and devised a plan to to kill soldiers which work on the orders of the government and he just found 20 soldiers searching for him.Graudaur left the forest and returned to to the laboratory to spectate the experiment results and to collect data on his future projects.

“Find everywhere he should be here somewhere,Be on your guard This is the last place left for search”,Some Soldier.Suddenly a soldier gets missing.“Where is Charlie”,a soldier in his mic.“We don't know he just suddenly gone missing”,some soldier said.“We have a report sir many soldiers are have gone missing”,some other soldier.“What do you mean search for them”,batallion leader said.Suddenly they found a cave with several soldiers half eaten  and a wolf monster in the corner eating them.“What the Fuck is going on here ,everyone shoot the damn thing”,leader said.Soldiers started shooting the beast but the wolf glared bach at them with highest bloodlust a animal can have in their entire life.Wolf started hunting the soldiers mercilessly by crushing their heads with his 4 inches teeth as it was the most effective and efficient method to kill the humans seen fit by the wolf.

Soldiers started Running away from the monstrosity in fear that the will be eaten any second.“what in the damn hell is that thing”,some soldier.“i don't know,how can I tell I have never seen such a thing”some other soldier.“The gates of hell have opened on the earth.May GOD have mercy on our poor souls”,a soldier was saying repeatedly out of fear of death.“Run you dimwits,if you all survived then party will be from my side”,leader shouted loudly as to raise the little morale he was able to.All the soldiers ran but they got eaten by the wolf one by one except the leader.Only the leader was able to outrun the beast by sacrificing all his fellow comrades.

Leader ran and ran until he reached the State border where he fainted due to loss of breath.He was rescued by the other soldiers stationed at the border.After several Hours,The Lucky man who was able to dodge his own death by the skin of his teeth awoke.He moved forword to assume a sitting position on the bed with eyes filled with fear and despair.He was at the time and was deeply traumatized by the incident.Several minutes later the door for the room opened and a lady in full black formal suit came in towards David.“I am a secret government agent working directly for the president,my information is highly clasifiesd so I can't give my name.So you name is david right. Tell me what happened at the search mission for the person named John liva?”,Secret Agent asked.“You won't even believe me if I tell you.you will call me crazy”,David said this in Deep despair.“What if I say I will believe you no matter what you say.”,Agent said.“If you are insisting then listen carefully…”,John explained the whole  incident in detail.“Ohkk,Thanks for the report we will investigate on the matter as much as we can”,Agent said.“You don't understand the situation.the damn thing is a human killing machine it killed all of my comrades back at the forest.don't tell me again that I didn't warned you”,David said.“Don't fret sir we have the best weapons the government has to offer but right now you should be concerned with your safety”,Agent said.

This report was highly classified and was directed to Vice-president but the Vice-president didn't inform the president about the forest incident and decided to take action on his own.At this point in time the beast had ingested 19 soldiers and an entire pack of wolves and its evolution was 80% complete and became 3.568 meters tall and turned into an absolute human destroyer.But this wasn't enough to decrease his hunger for flesh even e little bit.To search for more food the beast set out to the human settlements near the forest.The Wolf infiltrated the border by cutting the fence like spegaties and started hunting for the soldiers in the open.The information of a monster attacking the border spread like wildfire in the chain of command until the president came to know of this major incident and the recent forest incident.President called in the Vice-President immediately.

“Why are you fucking around,why the Fuck you didn't tell me that there was a monstrous creature found in the woods”,President said this in Deep anger.“That's not a way to talk for a president.please talk professionally,I am not you dog”,Vice president said.“First fix the situation right now or I am filing a report on you,you damn idiot”,President Said.

The beast killed and Killed then killed again until the border was wiped out of humans and the wolf evolved completely.The it entered the the roads filled with people.As the people saw the monster the started screaming and running to safe places and saving themselves from get eaten as it the first instinct comes to a rabbits mind when they see a predator hunting for them.The wolf started hunting for the the human flesh indiscriminately and was leaving a trail of half eaten humans.But few minutes later military arrived at the place and started firing rocket launchers at the monster.But the launchers weren't enough to take the thing down due to its Powerful regenerative abilities.

“President please Give the permission to use it,normal soldiers and weapons can handle the situation. If we wait any longer more and more casualities and collataral damage will occur”,Vice president said immediately.“I will Give you permission this time but I will not let you use the damn weapon on humans”, president said.

The tank with installed with ICBL(inter continental ballistic laser) arrived at the scene.“Fire the damn thing out of existence,A soldier shouted as their morale raised after the arrival of the newly invented weapon.But the weapon had a flaw that it required 60 seconds to charge.as the rotator started moving an order came to stall the beast for a single minute.soldier started firing so as to stall the monster for an entire minute.

One minute passed and 54 soldier died just to stall the monster for a single minute but the weapon was fully charged and was ready to fire.
After hearing that the weapon is fully charged the soldiers ran out of sight of fire and suddenly the monster attacked the canon and started tearing it apart slowly.After taking aim at its its the weapon fired in the sky.due to this fatal attack wolf died immediately.Soldiers started shouting out of victory and celebrated the following night in their own way of enjoyment.some went to parties and some went their own way to red light streets and other restaurants.

“Well! That was a success”,Graudaur said with a grin on his face.
At the same time Graudaur was also overjoyed due to success of the experiment and favourable results he got from the mutation.

After this incident world came to know about the existence of ICBL and the existence of a power that can create monsters as easily as baking cakes at his home.Scientists dissected the remains of the beast and found out that even the DNA structure of the creature was modified to a very large extent but they weren't able to identify it's origin.With this world started preparing for worst future case scenarios.
