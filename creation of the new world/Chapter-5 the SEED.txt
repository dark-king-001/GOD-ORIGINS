Several Days passed since the assassination incident of the Graudaur.Graudaur Bioengineered a pill which he called the SEED.It is a capsule which contains genetic data which can be called nucleus and a highly potent nutrient source for Kick starting the parasite which was created by Graudaur.He just needed to plant the seed into a Human body to create A monster.the capsule itself is of circular shape and white in color and 3mm in diameter.For the host Graudaur had also transplanted an undetectable communication Device and installed directly onto the Alisa's Auditory nerve.

“Hey! Where are you right now”,Graudaur asked Alisa through comm. Device.“lord I am currently on a mission Right now”,“Come to the base as soon as you complete your mission”,Graudaur Replied.
The Next Day at the morning
“Alisa I have created this pill and I want you to Give it to anyone and make sure the person swallows it”, Graudaur ordered.“What does this pill do My lord",Alisa replied.“Does it matter to you”,Graudaur said.“No lord not at all”,Alisa replied.“Then get go don't waste time”,Graudaur said.

At the evening Alisa arrived at the military headquarters and mixed the pill in the vine of a random Military soldier.at the time soldier swallowed it and it didn't caused and problems from the outside.But inside his body the pill matured into a living organism using the potent food storage and slowly started consuming on the liver of the body.A few days later it hijacked the nervous system and lymphatic system throughout the body.it caused the soldier to hallucinations and severe Infections throughout the body.The soldier fainted on the ground and was admitted to the nearby hospital for treatment.When the immune system weakened the SEED hyjacked the brain and released pain reduction and starvation harmones in the body which caused a chain reaction in the organs to digest the food quickly and make the brain to start looking for more food.

One Nurse entered the room and was horrified to see a person hungry for flesh.Soldier attacked the nurse.Nurse tried to resist but there not much se could do.Ghoul started eating her alive from limbs  to the internal organs.When large amounts of nutrients were ingested by the body.The seed stimulated the pituitary gland to release Huge Amounts of growth Harmone.Due to this the body muscles and bone structure reinforced itself and There was not a shred of humanity left in the body.The monster busted the window and left the hospital at the moment but the incident was reported to the investigation bureou.No one had seen or heard such crueality.A search for the missing soldier was initiated investigating the murderers tracks,personal records and abnormalities in the daily routine.But the investigation bureau found nothing of the sort.The thing seemed completely random at first.But things started to change when incidents started of men gone missing at mid-night.

The team of special enhanced soldiers was called into the investigation when thing didn't seemed normal.the enhanced team consisted of two men and a women named Drake David and Tina.All the three soldiers were especially trained to deal with supernatural incidents and David had already experienced the Wolf attack which costed him his entire team and after that he swore that he will never let that happen to anyone again in the future.The human enhancement drug had a. Different effect on every human because every human contain a different set of genetic data than other humans.In the current case Drake got body enhancement while David got High IQ and Tina got Sharp senses.and the drug had a same body buff effect on all three of them.

“Are you sure you can do this”,an investigation member said.“Who do you think we are",Drake said arrogantly.“Drake that's enough we are not some kind of super heroes which you watch In the movies.this is a real thing”,David said to Drake.“You are being stingy David just relax it will be a breeze dealing with this small mission”,“Huh how should I deal with him”,David thought to himself.“You guys be ready I sense something The culprit is mearby”,Tina alerted everyone.Suddenly a car came flying towards Drake.Drake catch the car bare hand and tossed it aside like a toy.“Look who's here”,Drake shouted.Tine sniped the ghoul but he disappeared into thin air and a split second later he was at the to of Tina trying to punch her.But Tina dodged it with instinct.“He is fast and powerful on top of that”,Tina said.The ghoul was 4 meters tall and had punched a crater in the ground.Suddenly Drake punched the ghoul into his gut and sent him flying 20 meters away into a building.The Ghoul got up and calculated every possible scenarios he had to go through to destroy the enhanced humans.He got up and started fighting Drake avoiding every bulled Tina shot from the sniper rifle.At the same time David pulled out his Dagger and swiftly stabbed the ghoul into the heart in the mere fraction of a second and said,“Die you spawn of the Devil”.Due to this The main heart stopped beating but apparently he already had a backup heart in the mean time main heart started healing itself.

Ghoul pulled out the dagger and threw in the air into a random area.suddenly the Ghoul started acting wierd.a wierd noice started coming from its back and the next moment wings came out of its back and Ghoul roared with very high creaking noise.It was the second phase of the SEED host.then Ghoul with twice the speed came towards David but it wasn't enough for reaching the David and in the next moment David was staring Ghoul into its eye and pierced both the eyes in a single attack.“What did he just do”,Drake was surprised.Ghoul took a step back.“i sensed a high energy conventration at this thing's stomach and we need to bust it as soon as possible”,David shouted.“Yes captain”,Tina said.Tina shot the Ghoul at its core where the seed was,and it destroyed the seed immidiatly.And with that the fight was over.“Good work tina that was brilliant”,David said.“What about me?”,Drake asked.“Naah! you didn't do much but now lets transport the corpse safely”,David said.

And in the next moment a man(Graudaur) appeared who was wearing formal clothes and was standing wery professionally.“Who are you this is a dangerous sight.civilians shouldn't be here”,Tina said.“Who is that man I couldn't sense it”,David thought.“My my such hostility lets start with the introduction i am Graudaur and what might your name be”, Graudaur said.Graudaur had changed his identity including his face and biomatrics.Graudaur picked up the corpse of the ghoul.“you shouldn't touch others property without their permission”,David was standing at the side of Graudaur.“You are fast but not fast enough and the thing you are calling your property is mine from the start”,Graudaur said.Graudaur disappeared without a trace.No one was skilled enough to track him.

Graudaur arrived at the laboratory and he put the ghoul into a chamber filled with Water.then he started repairing the SEED.fortunately the SEED itself wasnt damaged although the nerves connected to motors were highly damaged due to tina's shot.“They did a number on you didn't they”, Graudaur said

“Who was that man”,Drake said.“whoever he was,he was stronger than three of us combined.”,David said.“You are right my instincts were telling me to run when I laid my eyes on him”,Tina said.“Lets return to the headquarters and report this inciden”,David said.

“What!! You were unsuccessful to capture a single mutated human who was already dead according to you,I spent millions of dollers on the enhanced drug and this is the result you are giving me”,Vice president shouted.“Sir the thing is there was a man who called himself Graudaur and took the corpse.”,David said.“are you telling me you weren't able to handle a single human are you out of your mind.Get out of here right now,I don't wanr excuses”,Vice president shouted and David left the room.Even after use enhancement drug he saw someone far capable than him and was afraid of him at the same time.“Whoever this Graudaur person is I should be careful from now on”David thought.with this David started investigating who this person might be.
