A week passed since the Ghoul incident and Graudaur Created a sphere which was 2cm in radius and its sole purpose was to test how much power does humans posses and will use in a battle against him..The sphere was silver in color and possessed degraded version on Graudaur's energy control.it was only able to control properties of H20 molecules.An AI and several blueprints were installed so that the sphere could control its power at a very large scale effectively and efficiently.He planted the sphere in Deep into the ocean near United States Alaganta.

At the same time David and his team were training at the Headquarter's training centre.David was practising different actions he could take in several combat scenarios while Drake was testing his combat strength on the punching machine and Tina was cleaning her sniper rifle and hand guns.“Hey Guys! You all should see this”,a staff member shouted after just entering the room.Apparantly there was a news that an ICE island have appeared out of nowhere and is 1/10th size of Alaganta at the ocean of Great Alaganta.A satellite image showed that suddenly ocean started freezing and created an island in the ocean of Alaganta.Several moments later Vice-president called David.“David leave for the investigation immediately,it's urgent we need to collect information on the sudden appearance of the glacier”,Vice president said.a helicopter landed at the helipad above training faculty.

Several hours later David's team arrived at the scene and all three of them were shocked to see a single Glacier island.“it sure looks unreal to me”,Tina said.“ya that's true but this is totally unnatural phenomenon”,David said.“Then stop staring and start taking sample”,Drake said.“He said something meaningful for once”,David said.It was like a dream island.All of them started taking samples of the glacier.several minutes later steam started coming out of small four 50cm puddles.“Guys come here see this.Boiling water on an iced glacier”,Tina shouted.at the same moment cracks started appearing on the surface and an iced human shaped creature appeared.“I am the one who created this island and I ask you are you a friend or foe”,Ice King said.“Lets start with our names my name is david”,David said.“i asked are you a friend or foe”,Ice king raged.“We are friends we mean no harm”,David said.A helicopter appeared and started firing the ice king.“Those idiots”,David thought.Suddenly a long spike appeared from the ground and pierced through the helicopter destroying it in the process.“You are no friend you are foe.Die in despair”,The ice king said.Ice king disintegrated into thin air and noises started coming out of the ground.A Giant Centipede came out of the glacier purely made of iced water and started attacking.“We need a plan.Tina shouted.“Distract the centipede I will attack from its blind spot",David said.Drake started running in the direction of centipede grabbed its two human sized front legs.at the same moment David slashed the centipede from its middle section.It did sliced the centipede but its body absorbed the water through small pores connecting to its inner mechanism from the steam coming from the ground and its structure healed immediately.

After seeing this all of the team concluded that this situation is out of their hand.David called the headquarters from the transmitter on his right ear.“Its urgent situation we need backup as soon as possible.”,David reported.“we are dispatching a Helicopter from nearest island from south west equipped with nuclear bomb.it will arrive at your location in 10  minutes”,a control staff from headquarters replied.“You'all hear that we just need to hold this thing for another 10 minutes”,David said.“Seems easy enough to me”,Drake said.All three of them started dodging the attacks from the ice centipede and barely managed to stall it for 9 minutes.but at the last minute Centipede fired a compressed water shot at 3000psi+ pressure and tore through the ground like butter.David and Drake managed to barely avoid the she shot but unfortunately Tina lost her left hand.She tried to decrease the blood loss by closing the wound by tying a piece of cloth around the shoulder.But she already lost a great amount of blood and was feeling hazy.“Tina are you alright can you manage to fight”,David shouted from a distance.But she fainted at the moment.Fortunately a helicopter arrived and all three of them were rescued successfully.

A small scale missile was fired at the centipede to escape but the ice centepede recovered from it in several seconds.its healing ability was astonishing.After arriving at the nearest base Tina was admitted into the emergency ward.Several hours later she managed to opened her eyes but her conciousness was still hazy from the loss of too much blood.As soon as she waked up David gave her a visit.“so how's the wound”,David said.“Its still fresh docter said it will take at least a month to fully recover from the damage but as soon as I recover I will be in action”,Tina said.“Tina I have bad news for you”,David said with sorrow on his face.“what are you kidding me tell me its a joke”,Tina was shocked.“No it's official.Above orders are saying that they don't need a handicapped soldier on the team it will slow everyone down,so you are being removed from the team.”,David said.There was despair all over tina's face.It was a deep wound on her heart.

One hour ago..
“Why the hell you want to remove tina”,David said.“She is nothing more than a dead weight to the team”, Vice-president said.“What are you saying.you and I both know how valuable she is on the battlefield”,David said.“i don't need excuses.you heard my decision now leave”,Vice president said.

At the Graudaur's laboratory
“Hus those enhanced humans are doing pretty good,but a little more enhancement is required.lets make Tina a new test subject.On the other hand military power is pretty good but not enough.lts see what humans can do on their own”, Graudaur speculated

Due to injury of an enhanced soldier and a complete defeat on the ice island after watching the power displayed by the centipede..the whole nation started preparing for a war.
