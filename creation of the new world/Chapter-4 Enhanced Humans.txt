1 week passed Since the Wolf incident at the border of the state.Graudaur Decided to enter the Human Society to examine it from the inside to check if the humans are worth his time.

“Sir! We have just received a report that the missing John Liva has been found on the outskirts of the Forest from which we found the wolf”,Secret Agent Said.“Take him into custady right now I will be the one asking the questions,do you get it”, Vice-president said.“Yes Sir! Loud and clear”,Secret Agent said and left the room immediately.John Liva(Graudaur) Acted as if he had an amnesia and knew nothing of what happened to him in the past several weeks.John was brought to central police station and held captive at a room.Suddenly Vice-president entered the room.“There is no hiding it we know that you did experiments on Chromatinum”,vice president said.“i don't know what you are talking about and what is this you call chromatinum.i am a scientist and I have never heard of it”,John Liva said.“Do you think I am an idiot.you were missing for around 4 weeks and we don't know what you were doing in that time period.if you come clean then I will let you go or else”,vice President sad in anger.“else what are you going to lock me in joil or third degree torcher.Look I know what you are looking for and I also know how you can get it,if you make me the lead assistant in your research faculty then I will share my knowledge with you”,John liva said.“Do you know where you are sitting right now!.I can make you regret for your entire life”,Vice president said.“See president the thing is if I wanted to kill you then I would have done it by now.You are alive because I care about you a little.”,John liva said with a serius face.“Kill me are you out of your mind can't you see all these guards”,Vice president gave a major threat.Suddenly The Vice president became unable to breathe.“if you wanna go home alive then accepting the deal is your only chance.”,John came near vice president's ear whispered.Suddenly Vice president was able to breathe again.He took a long deep breath and said,"You son of a devil" and left the room.“Then that means you accept the deal then”,John shouted.“Take him to the research Centre.”,Vice president told the agent.

John Liva(Graudaur) was transferred to the Research centre and was promoted to assistant for the research on the anomaly of the appearance of mutant wolf and chromatinum.Graudaur found out that humans weren't able to replicate the structure of chromatinum so they had a last sample of it in the chamber and the remains of mutant wolf were being analysed at the top floor of the faculty.Apparantly Graudaur decided to snuck but the chamber was filled with all sorts of security measures but Graudaur hacked all of the security and stole the last sample to evolve his nanite body parts.Due to ingestion of the last sample of chromatinum the nanites gained the ability to replicate Indefinitely as long as he have spare energy left which he was able to extract from the atmosphere and due to this Graudaur gained immortality.Then he filled the sample tube with a similer substance to make everyone believe that nothing had happened and returned to the main hall.

“Can you tell me the way to the floor where I can find the remains of the mutant wold”,John said to the receptionist.“please me your name sir”, receptionist replied.“it's John liva”,John said nicely.“Lemme check sir.Sir take the lift to the 3rd floor the find the specimen lab there you will be able to find it”, receptionist replied.

John entered the lab and it was filled with all sorts of specimens.But he immediately found out the wolf specimen in no time.he started examining the cells of the wolf.“Fascinating! I didn't expected this much.the remote nanite device I implanted didn't gave me information after its death but look at this even after a week the cells are pretty much alive eating each other for survival.”,Graudaur said to  himself.Suddenly Vice president entered the lab.he had a suspicion that John was the one who created the whole mess and was after something.“What were you doing”,Vice president said.“Nothing Much Just examining the specimen I asked for”,John said.“So what are planning now",vice president said.“Nothing much! But As I promised you I will Give you power”,John said.“What kind of power”,Vice president said.“I will give you the formulae for creating enhanced humans”,John said.“And why should I belive you”,Vice president said.“Because we had a deal or did you forget already.Here is piece of advice don't ever forget a deal you make with a devil”,John whispered into the Vice-president's ear.

Graudaur decreased the effect of Wolf's body cells and created and development an injection for enhancing humans.The day of the presentation came.All the high officials participated in it because it was a revolutionizing experiment.“Thank you all ladies and gentlemen for spectating In my experiment.so Lemme show you two mouses of the same breed.Now his i an injection I created for enhancing any living creature,I have already injected a small dose in the one standing in the left”,John explained sa he put both the mouses on a spinning wheel.Now the Wheel on the left side started spinning 10 times faster than the one in the right.“Thats all ladies and gentlemen.this drug can enhance a human's body tenfold and the effect remains indefinitely,that's all for today”,John Said while ending the explanation part.But after a short while when the enhanced mouse was put among the other mouses it ate all of them in the matter of minutes but no one noticed as they were disintegrated into thin air by the vector control of the Graudaur.

Humans started using the drug on themselves and as expected they got enhanced bodies.a special unit of enhanced humans was created among the normal soldiers.After Vice-president got his own army through deal he immediately expelled the John from the faculty and John left peacefully.But due to Vice president's Suspicion he sent an assassin to kill the John.

After leaving the faculty john(Graudaur) informed his family that he is coming home.he travelled to meet the Family because the real John cared for his family and Graudaur had also absorbed his memories.After arriving home he got a heart warming welcome from his parents and his sister.Suddenly John made a serius Face.“What happened John”,John's mother.“I have an important work at the place where I had gone mossing”,John replied.“But why son you just came home?”,John's father asked.“i have important work to do and it's classified”,John answered.“Even your family?”,John's father.“yes!”,John replied.John left the room and walked to the park nearby.“I know you are there come out”,Graudaur Said facing a tree.Suddenly an female agent appeared from the tree.“How do you know I was here”,Agent asked.“Why does is matter anyway”,John replied.“Funny coming from a guy who is going to be dead soon”,Agent said.“Really! I am scared.I hope you at least Try”,John Laughed and said.Agent attacked his legs but He jumped and showed martial arts Both of them fought suddenly John Agents neck and said“is that it”.Agent pulled out a dagger and tried to stab John in the chest but John manipulated space-time continuum and suddenly Dagger wilted into iron sand.Then John punched the agent in the gut and she fainted immediately.

After this little incident next day John left his home bidding final farewell.Agent woke in the Graudaur's laboratory and looked around.“So you are finally awake”,Graudaur Said with fierce look.“Hah! So this is you lair.Its just a matter of minutes Other agents will come sniffing me”,Agent said with a grin on her face.“Are you talking about the transmitter transplanted near the left side of your heart",Graudaur said.Suddenly Despair appeared on the agent's face.“So! Let's start with the introduction.i am Graudaur living in John's body.Now your turn”,Graudaur said.“Huh why does it even matter.you are going to kill me anyways or if that that doesn't happen then I will kill myself as soon as you set me free.”,Agent said.“Why the Fuck are you Creatures so violent.at first you kill all flora and fauna then you kill your own kind and now when you see death then you kill yourself.If you are trying to protect that classified information that don't worry I have already extracted it through your brain.”,John said.“Huh my life doesn't even count any value”,Agent said.“Maybe not now but I can give you life value meaning if you infiltrate the Government as my spy”,John said.“Are you crazy are you telling me to become a double agent”,Agent said.“thats not it I want you to become my agent that means I will give you a new name and that will be your new life”,John said.“what if I refuse”,agent said.“That I will have no choice but to kill you right here and now”,John said.“My life don't have any meaning to it but if you promise me that I will live and have a meaning to my life then I accept your offer”,Agent Said.“Now your new name will be Alisa and also if try to betray me then I will kill you at the moment if you don't have a good reason to do so.So now the story is you killed me  and have returned to the headquarters”,John said.“Ok master”,Agent replied and returned to headquarters as told.

“That damn Vice-president I will give him a painful death but for now let's wait and proceed to the next experiment”,John said sand started working on the next project.
